    <h3>Build a CaaS (Comedian as a service)</h3>
    <p>There are many unfunny people in the world. Technology can save them.</p>
    <p>
      Your task is to extend the api at
      <a href="https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/">https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/</a
      >and let people use a simple query to get a joke on demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're prioritizing a working solution over a robust solution in this
      exercise. Feel free to implement an in-memory solution to caching if
      necessary and continue with the problem.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some progression steps</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Build a route that returns the joke id and joke, punchline included if
        it's a two-parter. You can choose which jokes you want to filter out
        from your system by checking the documentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implement some kind of caching/memoization for specific origins - User A
        doesn't want to be sent the same joke they've used before in a time of
        need but User B might want to use that joke. Feel free to import another
        package to help with this. Update the route from 1. such that if a joke
        has been told to the user before, send them a new joke.
      </li>
      <li>
        Users who use our service should be able to tell us how good a joke is.
        Build a route that takes in a joke id and a rating from 1-5 as params.
        The joke should be given that rating in your storage system. Assume only
        existing joke ID's will be sent in via this route. Update your route
        from part 1 to also send the rating for the joke, if it has one. If
        multiple users rate a joke, the rating returned should ideally be the
        average of all previous ratings.
      </li>
      <li>Any extra time should be put towards adding tests and debugging</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To test, use curl in a new instance of the the built-in terminal below
      with your route and params and view the terminal logs
    </p>
    <p>
      ex:
      <a href="https://74148.sse.codesandbox.io/ping"
        >curl https://74148.sse.codesandbox.io/ping</a
      >
      will return {"ping":true}
    </p>
